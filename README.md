# Alcohol Consumption Classification Using K-Means

This project demonstrates the use of the k-means clustering algorithm to classify alcohol consumption data. The notebook includes the following steps:

1. **Importing Libraries**: Load the necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and clustering.
2. **K-Means Algorithm**: Implementation of the k-means clustering algorithm from scratch.
3. **Elbow Method Algorithm**: Implementation of the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
4. **Importing Dataset**: Load the dataset containing alcohol consumption data.
5. **Data Analysis**: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset and handle missing values.
6. **Data Preprocessing**: Prepare the data for clustering by handling missing values and standardizing features.
7. **K-Means Clustering**: Apply the k-means algorithm to cluster the data.
8. **Visualization**: Visualize the clusters and analyze the results.
9. **Conclusion**: Summarize the findings and provide insights based on the clustering results.
